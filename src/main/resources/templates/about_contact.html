                    <p class="p-long">Alright, brace yourselves, because you're about to dive headfirst into a world of
                        sheer brilliance, unparalleled talent, and a whole lot of sass. 🌟 But hey, don't take our word
                        for it! Everything you're about to read below is 100% certified, Grade-A, prime-cut
                        bragging...courtesy of Jannhavi's imagination. So, without further ado, let's introduce you to
                        the superheroes behind the screens:</p>
                    <div>
                        <h2><strong>Jannhavi</strong></h2>
                        <p class="p-long"><em>Serial Chiller</em> 🦄</p>
                        <p class="p-long">By day, Jannhavi transforms into a data wrangler extraordinaire! 📊 Taming
                            spreadsheets and wrangling databases might sound chaotic (think corralling kittens!), but
                            she loves the challenge. Sure, she can build a basic website and speak the language of data
                            (enough to not get lost, at least!). But her true superpower lies in transforming that data
                            into actionable insights that make a positive impact! 💡 But enough about the day job -
                            let's get to the fun stuff! After hours, she unleashes her inner creative butterfly. 🦋
                            You'll find her rocking a killer outfit at an event she helped plan, or grabbing the mic and
                            inspiring the crowd with a public speech. Oh BTW, she loves shopping on Amazon (now you know
                            why this project exists!) 🛍️</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2><strong>Mayank</strong></h2>
                        <p class="p-long"><em>Vibe Killer</em> 💻</p>
                        <p class="p-long"><em>Level 100 Coding Master Here!</em> 💥 Mayank's love for code runs deeper
                            than lines in a Python script. He can practically code in his sleep (well, maybe not
                            literally, but close enough). Finding a coding partner-in-crime might be a challenge, but
                            hey, maybe he'll code the perfect one someday (don't worry, that's a joke... for now). 😄 In
                            all seriousness, he takes immense joy in crafting innovative solutions with the power of
                            code. It's like magic, but instead of wands, he uses algorithms and APIs. 🪄 Think of him as
                            Neo from the Matrix, but instead of dodging bullets, he's dodging bugs and deploying
                            awesomeness.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h2><strong>Nandini</strong></h2>
                        <p class="p-long"><em>Senior Drama-Queen</em> 🎨</p>
                        <p class="p-long">Adventure and design are Nandini's jam! 🌈 She's basically Indiana Jones with
                            a knack for data extraction, analysis, and whipping up killer designs. Don't get her wrong,
                            she can totally lead the team if needed (low-key boss moves, you know?), but most of the
                            time she's just a chill vibe master. 😎 That is, until a deadline approaches. Then, let's
                            just say things get...interesting. 😅 Think caffeinated whirlwind of creativity fueled by
                            sheer panic. But hey, somehow the magic always happens! ✨ Call her your laid-back design
                            ninja with a side of deadline drama.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="p-long"><em>(P.S. If you think these descriptions are a bit much, maybe Jannhavi had a
                            hand in them!)</em> 🙄 Because, you know, she totally thinks she's all that when she's just
                        a "Chiller"! 😄</p>
